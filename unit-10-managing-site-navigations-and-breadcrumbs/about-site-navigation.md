# About site navigation

## Overview

There are several different types of site navigation available on GovCMS websites. Menu items can be created within the **main header**, in the **sidebar** and in the **footer**. Dropdown navigation can also be set up so that the menu items drop down when a mouse hovers over them.

## Other navigation types

Other types of navigation include:

* A sitemap
* Breadcrumbs
* Sidebar ‘blocks’ with links to sub-pages
* ‘Go back to’ links that take the user back to the parent page in the navigation hierarchy

The GovCMS training website features only one level of navigation/menu structure. However, GovCMS allows for up to nine levels within the menu system.

**Note**: Web best practice suggests no more than three levels of navigation should be used if possible.
