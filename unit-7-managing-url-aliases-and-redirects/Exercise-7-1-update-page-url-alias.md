# Exercise 7.1 - Update a page's URL alias

In this exercise you will learn how to **update** a page’s URL alias.

1. Add a Page: From the _Admin menu_ click on _Content_, then hover over _Add content_ and click on _Page_.
2.  Fill out the fields as shown in the screenshot below, such as _Title_. On the right-hand side of the form, click to expand the _URL Alias_ section.\


    <figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (39).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
3. Uncheck _Generate automatic URL Alias_.
4. Make sure the 'URL alias' field is empty.
5. Set the _Save As_ dropdown to **Published**.
6. Click on the **Save** button at the bottom of the page.
7. Navigate to the page you saved - note the URL.

Your content should have a URL like: http://example.com/node/100

In this example “node/100” is the **internal** **Drupal path** for the page. The number "100" is a **unique** number that Drupal uses to store information about this specific page. In Drupal, this is called the "node ID". Each page will have a different number. The number "100" will be different on your site.

_**Note down this URL for the next exercise.**_
