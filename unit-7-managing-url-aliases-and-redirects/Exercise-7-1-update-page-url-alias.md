4. Make sure the 'URL alias' field is empty.
5. Set the _Save As_ dropdown to **Published**.
6. Click on the **Save** button at the top right of the page.
7. Navigate to the page you saved - note the URL.

Your content should have a URL like http://example.com/node/100. In this example “node/100” is the **internal** **Drupal path** for the page. The number "100" is a **unique** number that Drupal uses to store information about this specific page. In Drupal, this is called the "node id". Each page will have a different number.

_**Note down this URL for the next exercise.**_
