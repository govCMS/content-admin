# Capturing data with forms

Online forms \(HTML forms\) allow users to fill out information on a website and can be used to capture a variety of data/information. In GovCMS, forms can be created in the following ways:

* Creation of custom forms \(this requires development expertise and would be done by a development partner or in-house development team\).
* **Creation of a new webform using the "Webform Module" \(this is the recommended option for content authors\)**.

**Note** Forms can also be created by creating a new _Content type_. However, this method is not recommended as it can lead to mixing public form submissions with site content. The GovCMS **Contact Module** can also be used to create a form, however functionality is limited using this method.

## Webform module/content type

Webforms can be used to:

* Setup a complex ‘contact us’ form.
* Add a survey to your website.
* Include a feedback form on your site.
* Add an order form to your site.

Webforms can be set up to send emails to selected recipients when the form is submitted by a site visitor. Completed form submissions can also downloaded in bulk from the site.

The _Webform_ template is accessible from the content management area of GovCMS. To create a new _Webform_ click on _Content_ in the _Admin menu_, then hover over _Add content_ then click on _Webform_.

To view existing, previously created _Webforms_ click on _Structure_ in the _Admin menu_, then hover over _Webforms_ and click on _Forms_.

**Note:** In GovCMS 8, each _Webform_ is an independent _entity_; to attach metadata to _Webforms_ it has to be referenced from a _Webform_ _**content type**_. This approach allows for broader use-cases of webforms as independent entities and means they can be reused in multiple places.
