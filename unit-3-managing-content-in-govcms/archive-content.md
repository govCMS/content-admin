# Archiving content

{% embed url="https://vimeo.com/488354549" %}

In GovCMS sites \(as with most web sites\), content administrators will, from time to time need to remove **content** from their site. There are many cases in which conent may need to be removed, including _Events_ that have passed, _Blog articles_ or _News & Media_ that no longer need to be highlighted on a site, expired job listings and so on.

Archiving content in GovCMS simply **unpublishes** the content. It does not delete the content. As such you can restore the content if needed. 

The outcome of archiving any content is that it is **no longer visible to site visitors**. Should a site visitor navigate directly to the page that was previously available, they would receive an 'Access denied' message, as demonstrated in the next exercise.
