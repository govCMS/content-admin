5. You will be directed to a page asking if you are sure you want to delete the items. Confirm the action by clicking the **Delete** button. This will remove all the selected _Media_ entities from your training site.\


**Tip:** Don’t link or embed files directly by modifying HTML in your pages. Always use GovCMS functionality to add or upload Media. This ensures that links or images stay valid if a file is deleted from your site.

<mark style="color:red;">Warning - If you delete media, then those media will go missing from the content that were using them. Be careful when deleting media as this can break the design of those pages.</mark>
