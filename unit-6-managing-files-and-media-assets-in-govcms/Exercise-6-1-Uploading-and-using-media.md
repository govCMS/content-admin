# Exercise 6.1 - Uploading and using media

In this exercise you will upload an image directly to the media library (Part 1) and then use that image when creating content (Part 2).

## Part 1: Upload media file

1. Navigate to the _Media_ page by clicking on **Content** then **Media** on the _Admin menu_.
2.  Click the **Add Media** button at the top left of the page.

   1. Give it a short, descriptive name.
   2. Choose a file from your computer, using the **Browse** button.
   3. Click **Open** to upload the file.
5.  Add _Alt text_.

    **Note** Image alt text is required to enable screen readers and facilitate vision-impaired people.
6.  Click **Save**

## Part 2: Add media to a Page

1. Create a new Page following the instructions in [**Exercise 3.1**](../unit-3-managing-content-in-govcms/Exercise-3-1-Create-some-content.md)
2.  Click on Banner and then expand "Banner featured image". There you will see an _Add media_ button. \
    Note - you may not have a "Banner" tab if you are not using CivicTheme. In that case, find any Media upload field and use that.\

5.  Fill out any required fields for your _Page_ and click the **Save.** The image now appears on the frontend. The location of the image may be different on your site depending on your theme.\

6.  Navigate to **Content** â†’ **Files** from the _Admin menu_ and locate the image file you uploaded. It should be at the top of the list as it is the most recently added file. Note the name of the file.

7.  Next, click on the **Media** tab button and locate the Media entity that that points to the file you uploaded.

8. Discuss with the trainer, why the _Name_ of the file (from the _Files_ tab) is different to the _Media name_ (from the _Media_ tab).

**Tip**: The _Media_ entity allows you to enter a more user-friendly _Name_ (and other metadata) rather than using the name of the file.
