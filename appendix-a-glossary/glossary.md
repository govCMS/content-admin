| SEO                    | Search engine optimisation (SEO) is about creating a site that’s more likely to be returned in search results.

| Term                   | See Taxonomy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Text Format            | Plain text format means text contains no formatting such as bold/italics, coloured fonts, different font styles, etc. Rich text format allows text to be formatted with colours applied, etc. In a CMS if you have plain text only, using HTML tags would not format the text. For example, if you entered \<b>Bold\</b> that’s exactly what would be displayed on your site. But if you’re using a Rich Text editor, it would pick up the HTML tags and **Bold** would be displayed on your site.                                                                                                     |
| Theme                  | A theme is a GovCMS/Drupal extension that changes the way a website looks (and sometimes changes functionality). The default GovCMS theme has been designed with government websites in mind, however developers can add/change themes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| URL Alias              | <p>A URL that allows users to access a page using a short descriptive URL of your choice. E.g. /at/this/address</p><p>An <strong>automated alias</strong> is generated automatically and is based on predefined URL pathways. For example, it might include:</p><p>content-type/year/title and so the content might have the URL:</p><p><strong>/news/2019/Minister-announces-data-funding</strong></p>                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| User                   | An authorised website user, also a GovCMS entity, that includes user information such as login details (username and password).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
