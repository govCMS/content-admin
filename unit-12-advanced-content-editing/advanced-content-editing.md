Page layout in GovCMS is determined by your theme.

In the training site, we are using [CivicTheme](https://www.civictheme.io/) and the default components are shown in the screenshot below.

You can visualise these components by viewing the [CivicTheme Storybook](https://www.civictheme.io/themes/custom/civicthemeio/storybook-static/index.html?path=/story/base-menu--menu).
