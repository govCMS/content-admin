# Embedding media files

## Inserting Media into body - The Media Widget

You can insert images and videos directly into the _body field_ of a _Content form_ via the Media widget. Click on the _Media Library_ button from the WYSIWYG editor.

This will open the **Media widget**.

You can upload _images_ or _files_ from your computer by selecting "Select files"

Browse for and select a file on your local machine, then click **Open**.

## Embedding code - videos and URLs

Using the Media widget you can also use the Remote video form to embed videos in content (e.g. YouTube or Vimeo videos).

Click on the _Media Library_ button on the _Body_ content section. Click on the Remote video tab, then enter the following information:

* A url for the video you wish to embed.

Click on the **Add** button.

## Media Library

All files uploaded to a website (or already included) are found in the **Media Library**. Media assets are displayed with the most recently added first.

Use the following to refine the media presented:

* Enter text in the _Name_ field.
* Select from the dropdown to narrow the search to media items of type:
  * Audio
  * File
  * Image
  * Remote video
  * Video

Click the **Filter** button to perform the search.

In the screenshot below, the search word 'Govcms' has been entered into the _Name_ field and for **Type** "Remote video" is selected.

**Note:** _When you use a file from the Media Library or Files area, you are linking to a copy of the file, including its metadata. If you make changes to the file or its metadata, these changes will take effect for every use of the file on the site._
