## Media Library

All files uploaded to a website \(or already included\) are found in the **Media Library**. Media assets are displayed with the most recently added first.

When embedding media, select the **View** button to embed media from the site's _Media Library_. Use the following to refine the media presented:

- Enter text in the _Name_ field.
- Select from the dropdown to narrow the search to media items of type:
	- Audio
	- File
	- Image
	- Remote video
	- Video
- Enter text in the _Tags_ field.

Click the **Apply** button to perform the search.

In the screenshot below, the search word 'Sydney' has been entered into the _Name_ field.  The images listed now are only those with the word 'Sydney' in the filename.

Once a media file from the Media Library has been selected, click the **Place** button at the bottom of the popup dialog to add the media.

You will be presented with options for _Display as_, _Alternate text_, _Align_ and _caption_ as shown in the screenshot below

When an image is added into a _Rich text_ field, the image will be added at its original dimensions. You can change the image size within the CMS/Rich text editor by double-clicking on the image in the Rich text editor and selecting **Thumbnail** from the **Display as** dropdown. You can then choose a predefined _Image Style_ that will be applied to the image to adjust its size.

**Note:** _When you use a file from the Media Library or Files area, you are linking to a copy of the file, including its metadata. If you make changes to the file or its metadata, these changes will take effect for every use of the file on the site._
