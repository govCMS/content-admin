# Content references in GovCMS

Content Reference is a fantastic way to build relationships between different content in GovCMS. Some examples of a relationship would be:

*   An Event category taxonomy term associated with an Event

    <img src="../.gitbook/assets/35 (2) (2) (1).png" alt="" data-size="original">
*   One content page referencing another content page or a few pages (check the homepage of your training site):

    <img src="../.gitbook/assets/36 (2) (2).png" alt="" data-size="original">
*   Content pages referencing an image or user

    <img src="../.gitbook/assets/37 (2) (2).png" alt="" data-size="original">
