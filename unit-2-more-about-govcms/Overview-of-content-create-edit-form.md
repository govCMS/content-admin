## The Content form

When creating or editing any _content_ in GovCMS, you’ll use the **Content form**.

Each of the different **content types** mentioned in the previous page can have different custom areas depending on how a site is configured.

At the same time, there are many areas common to _all_ content creation forms.

An overview of the **Page form** is shown below to highlight these common areas.

The areas highlighted are:

1. **Title:** Type in your content’s title.
2. **Components:** Add Components to the page (Components are discussed in [**unit 12**](https://salsa-digital.gitbook.io/govcms-content-administration/unit-12-advanced-content-editing/using-components-for-rich-layout-options) of this manual)
3. **Save and Preview** buttons.
4. **Revision log message:** Leave some helpful text to explain your changes. This is not visible to the public.
