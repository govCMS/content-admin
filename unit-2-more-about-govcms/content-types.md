## Content types used in GovCMS

GovCMS websites are made up of different _content types_. You can view a list of the GovCMS _content types_ that are available “out-of-the-box” by hovering over _Content_ on the _Admin menu_ then clicking on **Add content**.

Many of these content types are used across all GovCMS sites. Each content type has specific fields \(properties and metadata\) associated with it.

The standard GovCMS content types are:

* Blog Article
* Event
* FOI
* News and Media
* Standard Page
* Web form

### Why use different content types?

_Content types_ are a useful way to group similar content, with similar characteristics. It means people can talk about sets of content \(such as _Events_\) using the same language.  Content types also provide a way to set up a common template across a type. 

For example, events will always have a time, date and location and so the event content form contains these fields. Other types of content may not include all these pieces of information.

Content types are also used when setting display rules for the site. An example is showing the three most recent _Blog articles_ on the homepage.

Further general information on content types is available in the _[Drupal Documentation](https://www.drupal.org/docs/7/understanding-drupal/content-types)_.
