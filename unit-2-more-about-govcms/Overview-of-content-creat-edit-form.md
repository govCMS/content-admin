## The Content form

When creating or editing any content in GovCMS, you’ll use the **Content form**.

Each of the different **content types** mentioned in the previous page can have different custom areas depending on how a site is configured. 

At the same time, there are many areas common to _all_ content creation forms. 

An overview of the **Standard page form** is shown below to highlight these common areas.
