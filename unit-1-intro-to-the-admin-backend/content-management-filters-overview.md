## Using the filters area of the content management page

You can use the _filter section_ of the _content management area_ to search and display specific content.

Use the filters to display a customised list of content:

* **Title:** Type in search words to display content with a _title_ that matches your search.
* **Content type:** Select a _content type_ to only display that type of _content_.
* **Published status:** Select the _published status_ to show only published or only unpublished content.
* **Language:** Select from the dropdown list to display only content in a specific _language_.

Once youâ€™ve made your selections \(you can use one or all of the filters above\) click the **Filter** button to filter content based on the criteria entered and/or selected.
