7. The next screen will ask if you want to "Trust this browser". This is an optional step but it's recommended to check this box if you want to bypass TFA the next time you log in. Click on Save.
8.  The confirmation page will say "TFA enabled".

**What happens if you choose not to "Trust this browser"?**

After logging in, you will be presented with the TFA page. Click on Send to receive the email code.&#x20;

If you do not click on Send, no code will be sent to your email.

## The Admin Menu

The band running across the top of the page (2.) is called the “Admin menu”, and is an indication that you’re currently logged into the site (as opposed to simply visiting it as an “anonymous” user).

You may see or hear the Admin menu also referred to as **“Administration”**, **“Admin bar”**, **“Admin toolbar”**, **“Navbar”**, or simply **“Toolbar”**.

The Admin menu helps people who have logged into the site (such as site administrators, content authors/reviewers, etc.) to navigate more quickly through the various pages of the admin interface. Once logged in, it’s available in the frontend and backend of your GovCMS site.
