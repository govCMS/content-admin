After successfully logging in as an administrator, you will be redirected to a page that shows the following:

1. Your username as the page ‘title’.
2. A message indicating how long your account has been active on the site.
3. The **Admin menu**.
4. The username of the account you’re currently logged in with.

**Note:** Some elements from the screenshot below may be different, due to permissions settings.

## The Admin Menu

The band running across the top of the page \(3.\) is called the “Admin menu”, and is an indication that you’re currently logged into the site \(as opposed to simply visiting it as an “anonymous” user\). 

You may see or hear the Admin menu also referred to as **“Administration”**, **“Admin bar”**, **“Admin toolbar”**, **“Navbar”**, or simply **“Toolbar”**.

The Admin menu helps people who have logged into the site \(such as site administrators, content authors/reviewers, etc.\) to navigate more quickly through the various pages of the admin interface. Once logged in, it’s available in the frontend and backend of your GovCMS site.
